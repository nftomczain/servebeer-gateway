# ServeBeer IPFS Gateway

![Multi-Jurisdiction Gateway](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fe48ac1-c5d7-42a8-85aa-5971ac99996f)

Public IPFS HTTP Gateway running on community-powered infrastructure. Decentralized content access with HTTPS, multi-jurisdiction copyright compliance, and minimal logging.

## üî• Project Background

**ServeBeer** is the evolution of **Pi-Grade** - a campaign to upgrade Raspberry Pi infrastructure through transparent community funding. What started as a request for hardware donations became something bigger: proving that meaningful decentralized infrastructure can run from someone's room, not just corporate datacenters.

**The Vision:**
- **Accessibility through technology** - Building tools that work on modest hardware
- **Transparent funding** - Crypto-based community sponsorship model
- **Ghost Layer** - Infrastructure for the digitally excluded
- **Living proof** - Not vaporware, but working code on real hardware

This gateway has been running 24/7 for over a year on Raspberry Pi hardware, serving the IPFS community and proving that "guerrilla infrastructure" is viable.

**Related Projects:**
- **NFTomczain** - Personal manifest of survival through technology
- **NetNeroJes** - Political manifest for digital inclusion
- **Pi-Grade** - Original hardware upgrade campaign (pi-grade.nftomczain.eth)

Built by someone who learned to code on ZX Spectrum and believes that technology should empower everyone, regardless of physical limitations or corporate backing.

## Features

- **IPFS/IPNS Gateway** - Access any IPFS content via HTTP/HTTPS
- **Multi-Jurisdiction Copyright Compliance** - Pluggable system for DMCA (US), DSA (EU), French, and Polish law
- **Official IPFS Denylist** - Auto-syncs with IPFS community blocklist (156+ CIDs)
- **Smart Blacklist** - Local + official lists merged, categorized by reason
- **HTTP 451 Blocking** - Legal-compliant content blocking
- **SSL/TLS Support** - Secure access with Let's Encrypt certificates
- **Auto-sync** - Background updates every 24h
- **Admin API** - Blacklist and jurisdiction management endpoints
- **GDPR Logging** - Minimal request logging for compliance
- **Privacy-First** - No tracking, no analytics, no third-party cookies
- **Lightweight** - Runs on Raspberry Pi hardware

**Why this matters:** Every independent gateway strengthens IPFS resilience. Corporate infrastructure is important, but so are community-run nodes. This proves you don't need a datacenter - just dedication and a Raspberry Pi.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- IPFS Kubo (go-ipfs) daemon
- SSL certificates (for HTTPS)
- SQLite3

**Hardware:** Tested and proven on Raspberry Pi 3B+ and Pi 400. Should work on any Linux system with similar or better specs.

**Philosophy:** If it runs on a Pi in someone's room, it should run anywhere. No cloud required.

## Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/nftomczain/servebeer-gateway.git
cd servebeer-gateway

# Run installer
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Manual Install

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create directories
mkdir -p database logs
touch blacklist.txt

# Setup configuration
cp .env.example .env
nano .env  # Edit with your settings
```

### IPFS Setup

Follow the official installation guide for your architecture:
https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/#install-official-binary-distributions

**Note:** This gateway runs on Raspberry Pi (ARM64 architecture).

```bash
# Initialize and start IPFS daemon
ipfs init
ipfs daemon
```

## Configuration

Edit `.env` file:

```bash
# Server
APP_HOST=0.0.0.0
APP_PORT=8081  # Used if no SSL certificates found

# IPFS Gateway
IPFS_HTTP_GATEWAY=http://127.0.0.1:8080

# Database & Logs
DATABASE_PATH=database/servebeer.db
LOG_FILE=logs/servebeer_audit.log

# Blacklist
BLACKLIST_FILE=blacklist.txt
IPFS_DENYLIST_FILE=blacklist-ipfs-official.txt

# DMCA Email (optional)
DMCA_SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
DMCA_SMTP_PORT=587
DMCA_SMTP_USER=your@email.com
DMCA_SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
DMCA_NOTIFY_TO=dmca@yourdomain.com
```

### SSL Certificates

Place certificates in `/home/user/cert/`:
- `fullchain.pem` - Full certificate chain
- `privkey.pem` - Private key

Or modify paths in `app.py` function `create_ssl_context()`.

## Usage

### Run Development Server

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
sudo python3 app.py
```

The application will:
1. Download official IPFS denylist (if missing or older than 24h)
2. Start background auto-updater (syncs every 24h)
3. Launch on port 443 (HTTPS) or 8081 (HTTP fallback)

### Run as Systemd Service

```bash
# Copy service file
sudo cp servebeer-gateway.service /etc/systemd/system/

# Edit paths in service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/servebeer-gateway.service

# Enable and start
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable servebeer-gateway
sudo systemctl start servebeer-gateway

# Check status
sudo systemctl status servebeer-gateway
```

### Access Gateway

```
https://your-domain.com/ipfs/{CID}
https://your-domain.com/ipns/{NAME}
```

Example:
```
https://ipfs.servebeer.com/ipfs/QmYwAPJzv5CZsnA625s3Xf2nemtYgPpHdWEz79ojWnPbdG
```

## Blacklist Management

### Local Blacklist

Add CIDs with reasons to `blacklist.txt`:

```bash
# Format: CID reason
QmBadContentCID123 malware
QmAnotherBadCID456 copyright
QmPhishingSite789 phishing
```

**Available reasons:**
- `malware` - Malicious software
- `phishing` - Phishing attempts
- `copyright` - Copyright violations
- `dmca` - DMCA takedowns
- `policy_violation` - Terms of Service violations

### Official IPFS Denylist

Automatically synced from: https://github.com/ipfs/infra/blob/master/ipfs/gateway/denylist.conf

- **Auto-downloaded** on first startup
- **Auto-updated** every 24 hours in background
- **Merged** with local blacklist (local has priority)
- **156+ CIDs** from IPFS community reports

### Manual Sync

Force synchronization with official denylist:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/admin/sync-ipfs-denylist
```

### Blacklist Priority

1. **Local blacklist** (`blacklist.txt`) - custom reasons
2. **Official IPFS denylist** - community-identified malware/abuse
3. If CID in both lists, local reason takes priority

Blocked content returns **HTTP 451 (Unavailable For Legal Reasons)**.

## Admin API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/admin/blacklist-stats` | GET | Blacklist statistics by reason |
| `/admin/test-blacklist/{cid}` | GET | Test if CID is blocked |
| `/admin/reload-blacklist` | POST | Reload local blacklist (clears cache) |
| `/admin/sync-ipfs-denylist` | POST | Force sync with official IPFS denylist |

**Examples:**

```bash
# View statistics
curl https://ipfs.servebeer.com/admin/blacklist-stats

# Test CID
curl https://ipfs.servebeer.com/admin/test-blacklist/QmXXX...

# Reload local blacklist
curl -X POST https://ipfs.servebeer.com/admin/reload-blacklist

# Sync official denylist
curl -X POST https://ipfs.servebeer.com/admin/sync-ipfs-denylist
```

## Monitoring

### Check Logs

```bash
# Audit log
tail -f logs/servebeer_audit.log

# Database logs
sqlite3 database/servebeer.db "SELECT * FROM audit_log ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10"

# Filter blacklist hits
tail -f logs/servebeer_audit.log | grep BLACKLIST
```

### Health Check

```
https://your-domain.com/health
```

Returns JSON with IPFS, database, and blacklist status:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-10-11T01:35:51.677081+00:00",
  "ipfs": "ok",
  "database": "ok",
  "blacklist": 146
}
```

### Abuse Monitoring

```bash
# Run abuse check script
./check_abuse.sh

# Shows:
# - Top requested CIDs
# - Top IPs by request count
# - Blacklist hits
```

## Copyright Compliance

### Multi-Jurisdiction Plugin System üåç

**Global problem:** Copyright law varies dramatically by country. DMCA (USA), DSA (EU), French moral rights, and Polish personal rights all have different requirements.

**ServeBeer solution:** Pluggable copyright compliance system that adapts to your jurisdiction.

**Why this matters:** Most gateways treat copyright as "one size fits all" with US DMCA. This is wrong for operators in EU, France, Poland, and elsewhere. Our plugin system respects local law.

**Available Jurisdictions:**

| Code | Region | Law | Response Time | Key Features |
|------|--------|-----|---------------|--------------|
| **US** | United States | DMCA (17 U.S.C. ¬ß 512) | 48h | Safe harbor, counter-notice |
| **EU** | European Union | DSA (Reg. 2022/2065) | 24h | Transparency, right to complain |
| **FR** | France | Code de la propri√©t√© intellectuelle | 72h | Moral rights (perpetual, inalienable) |
| **PL** | Poland | Ustawa o prawie autorskim | 72h | Personal rights, criminal liability |

Set your jurisdiction in `.env`:
```bash
COPYRIGHT_COUNTRY=PL  # or US, EU, FR
```

**Each plugin provides:**
- ‚úÖ Jurisdiction-specific notice templates
- ‚úÖ Required field validation per local law
- ‚úÖ Localized blocked content pages
- ‚úÖ Appropriate legal references and SLA times
- ‚úÖ Counter-notice/appeal procedures

**Extensible:** Add new jurisdictions by creating plugins. See `COPYRIGHT_PLUGINS.md` for details.

**Addressing r/ipfs feedback:** This system was developed in response to community concerns about copyright compliance in different countries. One French user correctly pointed out that "you need help from competent people (lawyers)" - and they're right. This plugin system doesn't replace legal advice, but it provides the technical framework for implementing country-specific requirements.

### File Takedown Notice

Users can file copyright notices at:
```
https://your-domain.com/copyright/report
```

Required information:
- Copyright owner name
- Contact email
- Infringing CID
- Description of copyrighted work
- Good faith statement
- Signature

### Response Process

1. Notice logged to database and sent via email
2. Review within 48 hours
3. Valid CID added to `blacklist.txt`
4. Complainant notified of action taken

## Blacklist Categories

The gateway categorizes blocked content:

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `dmca` | 106 | DMCA takedown notices |
| `malware/phishing` | 17 | Malicious content |
| `copyright` | 8 | Copyright violations |
| `malware` | 4 | Malware only |
| `ipfs-official-denylist` | 156+ | IPFS community blocklist |

## Security Considerations

- **Content Responsibility**: Gateway operator is not responsible for user content
- **HTTP 451**: Legal-compliant blocking with proper status code
- **Copyright Protection**: Maintain safe harbor through takedown process
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider adding Flask-Limiter for production
- **Monitoring**: Regular log review recommended
- **Auto-updates**: Official denylist syncs every 24h
- **Blacklist Priority**: Local list overrides official for custom reasons

## Performance

Tested on Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM):
- 50-100 concurrent requests
- ~10ms response time (cached content)
- 99%+ uptime
- 5-minute blacklist cache
- Background denylist sync (24h interval)

For higher loads, consider:
- Multiple backend IPFS nodes
- Nginx reverse proxy
- CDN for static content

## Philosophy

**"Fire beneath the ashes, code as memory"**

This project represents more than infrastructure - it's a statement that meaningful decentralization happens everywhere, not just in datacenters. 

**Core Beliefs:**
- **Accessibility matters** - Tools should work on modest hardware, not require enterprise budgets
- **Transparency builds trust** - Open source code, public metrics, honest limitations
- **Community over corporations** - Grassroots infrastructure strengthens the network
- **Technology as empowerment** - Code can compensate for physical limitations
- **Guerrilla infrastructure** - One Pi in a room is still decentralization

**Built with assistance from AI as a compensatory tool** - transparently acknowledging that Claude helps organize documentation and speed up development for someone with memory challenges and physical limitations. The architecture, decisions, and vision are human. The collaboration makes it possible.

**For the digitally excluded, the physically limited, and the technically curious** - if ServeBeer can run on a Raspberry Pi in Warsaw, you can build something too.
